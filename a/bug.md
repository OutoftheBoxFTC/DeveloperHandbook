# Code fails when X does Y

**Date of Submission:** 4-20-2015

**Description:** When the robot is on the field doing X, and the situation involves Z, A, and B happening, our robot behaves in a manner that is incorrect because it does b instead of c.

**Background Info/Context:** We were operating in Teleop mode and our robot was doing This thing, That thing, and our robot was in Z mode. Some likely triggers to this failure were the fact that This thing is too memory intensive, leading to X failure. 

**Expected Result:** Our robot is able to do X, and Y does not occur.
  
**Error Code *(Optional but highly reccommended)*:**
```
Null Pointer Exception on line 10!
java.io.me: error
